We adapted this guide from the work of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design), and thank their content team for championing plain language and information accessibility.

## Style guides

We generally follow [AP style](https://www.apstylebook.com/) unless otherwise noted. If there is a difference in addressing an item between the AP style and NASA style, use the NASA style. If there is a difference in addressing an item between the NASA Stylebook or Graphics Standards and this guide, use the Stylebook or Graphics Standards.
