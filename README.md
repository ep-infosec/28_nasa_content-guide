## NASA Glenn Content Guide

This is the repository for the [NASA Glenn Content Guide](https://nasa.github.io/content-guide/). This guide was developed for NASA Glenn employees, but we hope itâ€™s a useful reference for anyone. It is a fork of the [18F Content Guide](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/)

### Editing the Guide
The pages in the guide are broken into four sections corresponding to four folders in the [```_pages```](https://github.com/nasa/content-guide/tree/master/_pages) folder. The markdown files within each section can be edited using GitHub. If you are new to editing files in GitHub [this guide](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) should help. Just ignore the part about creating a new branch and commit your changes directly to the master branch. If you are new to using markdown [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) should help. When you commit your changes to the master branch CircleCI will automatically push your changes to the [site on GitHub Pages](https://nasa.github.io/content-guide/). It may take up to a few minutes for your changes to be viewable on the site.
